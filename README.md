# Jammming

## Description

This project was completed as part of the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer skill path; it constitutes a portfolio project on the skill path.

This web application interacts with the Spotify API. It allows a user to sign in to their account, search for songs, browse through search results, add search results to a new Spotify playlist, and add that new playlist to their account.
